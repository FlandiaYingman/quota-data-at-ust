These incidents include floods, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, blizzards, and snowstorms. We are amid a once-in-a-century pandemic where millions have already lost their lives. We are seeing a war all but in name that is broadcasted on 24/7 news networks. All these incidents affect not just nearby countries but have global impact affecting all countries to a lesser or greater extent. These impacts are not just rocking global geopolitics, they are also tumbling our 21st century inter-connected and inter-reliant economies. One of the most gyrating industries is civil aviation, which at one point collapsed to just 05% of its former self. One lesson learned in the aviation industry is the need for all industry stakeholders to build up operational resilience. Strengthened operational resilience enables all stakeholders to meet risks and threats that can come from anywhere around the globe. This course will explore what is operational resilience, why it is important, and how to achieve it."
