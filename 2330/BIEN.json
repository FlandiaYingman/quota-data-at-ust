The aim of this course is to present some of the basic science and human physiology knowledge used by biomedical engineers and illustrates the first steps in applying this knowledge to solve problems in human medicine. The second goal of this course is to link knowledge of basic science and engineering to fields of specialization and current research. This course also introduces the sub-specialties in biomedical engineering and through real-life examples to emphasize the types of problems biomedical engineers solve."
