Students will engage in an experiential learning study project and a mini-research task; they will also learn chemical concepts through many real-life case studies. The basic ideas and principles of chemistry, as well as many chemical topics of everyday relevance will be discussed in this course: such as air, water, metals, minerals, air pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, batteries, fire and fuels, food and drinks, household chemical products and plastics. Students taking this course are not required to have studied Chemistry before."
