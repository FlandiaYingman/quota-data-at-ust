The curriculum is thoughtfully structured to instill a comprehensive understanding of water-related processes within the Earth's environmental system. It covers five central topics: climate systems, water resources, engineering design, data science applications in water sustainability, and the potential of artificial intelligence. By exploring these areas, students will grasp the interconnectedness of these components and learn how to utilize this knowledge in the development of strategic solutions for climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. This course equips students with the ability to tackle complex water resources challenges emerging from shifting climatic conditions, using a data-driven approach and innovative AI technologies. The ultimate aim is to prepare students to contribute effectively towards achieving water sustainability in our changing world. The course assessment is based on three key components: active participation in class discussions, in-class written Quizzes, detailed presentations on assigned topics, and comprehensive reports on relevant subject matter. This comprehensive approach ensures that students are engaged, articulate, and able to critically analyze and apply the concepts learned throughout the course."
