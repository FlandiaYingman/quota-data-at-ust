Last, we will introduce reinforcement learning to build autonomous infrastructure systems that learn to make good decisions. One key feature of this course is its application-driven nature. All applications of this course are about smart infrastructure systems. Through those applications, students will know how ML can be applied in their future career and research."

The course will further emphasize on the proper use of ML for civil engineering applications, including incorporating physics-based knowledge (physics-informed ML), dealing with data acquisition challenges (design of experiment, global optimization), and so on. Students will learn to address some unique challenges of applying ML to real-world engineering applications, preparing themselves better in their future career."

It also covers vibration-based structural health monitoring. Students will learn about the fundamentals of structural behavior, and analysis in the time and frequency domain. For data science, this course introduces fundamental knowledge and practical applications of data science and machine learning in the structural engineering context, primarily from understanding and extracting informative patterns from structural sensing data. Students will also learn about the use of relevant software & toolboxes (Python) to apply the discussed data science concepts on structural sensing datasets."

      "description": "This course describes the physics of the climate system and how it is represented in numerical models. It covers global environmental issues related to climate change resulting from both human activities and natural climate variations, and introduces the basic structures of climate models. This course aims to equip students with a solid understanding of the physical climate system and the underlying principles of current climate assessments. It teaches students which aspects of climate science are well understood and where quantitative uncertainties arise. As climate models are one of our primary tools for predicting and adapting to climate change, it is vital that we appreciate their strengths and limitations. The course includes a combination of lectures, homework assignments, a mid-term exam, and a term project of climate model analysis. The lectures provide students with fundamental knowledge of the physical processes in the climate system and basics of climate modeling. Homework assignments reinforce the knowledge base and enhance problem-solving skills for students. The mid-term exam will assess the learning outcome. The term project provides hands-on training on utilizing climate models to understand climate change and make informed decisions."
