      "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting every sphere of our work and lives, bringing unprecedented risks to society. This introductory course surveys the explosive area of AI ethics, illuminating relevant AI concepts with no prior background needed. Fake news bots. AI driven social media displacing traditional journalism. Drone warfare. Elimination of traditional jobs. Privacy‐violating advertising. Monopolistic network effects. Biased AI decision/recognition algorithms. Deepfakes. Autonomous vehicles. Automated hedge fund trading. No area remains untouched. Policy think tanks, governments, and tech companies around the world have started paying serious attention to AI ethics. How will human civilization survive the rise of AI? What are the new rules? What are the ethical frameworks needed to avoid extinction? What are engineers’ and entrepreneurs’ ethical responsibilities?"

Students who have passed COMP2633 and have gotten the instructor consent can join this course, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP2633 and this course, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity competitions. The students will get 2 credits for successfully completing this course. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving. Instructor's approval is required."

From parsing ad-hoc configuration file formats to validating complex specification languages to generating efficient code solving data-intensive problems at scale, many important problems of today and tomorrow require knowledge of basic compiler technology. The course exposes students to the essentials of modern compiler construction, including parsing, semantic analysis, program transformation, and code generation. Students will learn to design and implement their own programming language and extend it with a feature of their choice in a small team project. The course focuses on achieving these goals through effective high-level programming techniques, whose mastery will also make students a better programmer in general."

      "description": "This course will expose students to new and practical issues of real world mining and managing big data. Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment."

It will give students a chance to work with emerging video technologies such as deepfakes. Whether students have music or video background or not, this course will provide them a chance to create like a sound designer and director. For each of their music video creations, students will also create a behind-the-scenes commentary video that describes what they did and how they did it. They will share their creations and commentaries in class, and learn from and be inspired by one another."

(1) Basic concepts of Cloud Computing and production Cloud services; (2) MapReduce - the de facto datacenter-scale programming abstraction - and its open source implementation of Hadoop. (3) Apache Spark - a new generation parallel processing framework - and its infrastructure, programming model, cluster deployment, tuning and debugging, as well as a number of specialized data processing systems built on top of Spark. By walking through a number of hands-on labs and assignments, students are expected to gain first-hand experience programming on real world clusters in production datacenters."

Thus, the computation in the training or inference of the foundation model could be one of the most important workflows running on top of modern computer systems. This course unravels the secrets of the efficient deployment of such workflows from the system perspective. Specifically, we will i) explain how a modern machine learning system (i.e., PyTorch) works; ii) understand the performance bottleneck of machine learning computation over modern hardware (e.g., Nvidia GPUs); iii) discuss four main parallel strategies in foundation model training (data-, pipeline-, tensor model-, optimizer- parallelism); iv) real-world deployment of foundation model including efficient inference and fine-tuning."
