      "description": "This course is a mathematical introduction to data analysis and visualization with a perspective of topology and geometry. Topics covered include: classical linear dimensionality reduction, the principal component analysis (PCA) and its dual multidimensional scaling (MDS), as well as extensions to manifold learning, topological data analysis, and sparse models in applied math/high dimensional statistics. Extensive application examples in biology, finance, and information technology are presented along with course projects.",
