In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes.

In view of these, research on the decision making and strategic interaction under risk and uncertainty have been extremely active for the past few decades. This course aims to provide an introduction to this exciting field of research and suggestions for further exploration. The first part of the course is devoted to the economics of uncertainty and covers topics including the expected-utility model, market allocation of risks and asset pricing. The second part of the course is devoted to the economics of information and covers topics including moral hazard, bargaining, auction theory, mechanism design, and information aggregation in the market."

This course studies both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing. Topics include housing demand and supply analysis, equilibrium models of housing market, rationales and effects of public policies on housing, causes and consequences of housing market dynamics and crisis.

The underlying idea is to completely understand the firm. To do so, we will begin by understanding the industry and market trends. We will then systematically develop valuation techniques from the ground up as well as understand the limitations of the current standard forms of valuation. We will apply these techniques and the framework developed to study specific companies. Finally, we will discuss the construction of the portfolio and issues of portfolio management."

In this course, students will learn how to solve various models analytically using dynamic programming and sequential methods. Key topics in monetary policy (or monetary economics) such as money neutrality, super money neutrality, the Fisher equation, Friedman rule, equilibrium determinacy, time inconsistency and reputation in monetary policy are also explored in this course. Numerical solution techniques are emphasized with calibration and simulation methods taught using Matlab, Octave and Dynare, to compute the quantitative impact of economic shocks and policy events. Bonus computing workshops will be provided.  Applications to policy and real-world phenomena are emphasized throughout."

The first 4-5 weeks provide coverage of basic international finance topics including global imbalances, current account sustainability, theories to explain the current account, determinants of real exchange rates, and international capital integration. These foundation concepts, together with the knowledge you have gained in ECON 5140 are used to develop an understanding of modern graduate-level open economy macroeconomics. We will study international business cycles in data and models with increasing levels of sophistication including the open economy real business cycle model. Students will not only learn how to solve various models analytically using pen and paper but also through using numerical solution techniques in Matlab, Octave, and DYNARE, to compute the quantitative impact of economic shocks and policy events. Bonus computing workshops will be provided. Applications to policy and real-world phenomena are emphasized throughout. Assumed knowledge is ECON 5140."

This is accomplished by making psychologically-sound assumptions about preferences, beliefs, and constrained maximization to account for a wide range of behavior. The course covers three topics: (1) decision making under risk (loss aversion, probability weighting, reference dependence); (2) decision making across time (self-control, timing preference), (3) other-regarding preference (altruism, fairness, reciprocity). Evidence from financial market, saving behavior, labor market and other areas will be used to show how behavioral economics can be fruitfully applied to yield important insights into behavior under different settings. The course emphasizes the interplay among observable behavior, underlying psychology, and economic models. Overall, this course aims to help you develop skills on (1) how to incorporate psychology could help explain economic behavior, (2) how to apply behavioral economics to various economic and business settings."

In particular, we will focus on two kinds of market mechanisms: matching and auction. If time permits, we may also discuss the design of financial markets. We will learn some theory, and then we will also learn how to use the theory to analyze and design markets for practical use. This course will be taught in a seminar format. Prepare to actively participate in discussions."

      "description": "This course teaches classical and recent applied econometric methods in empirical microeconomics for Ph.D. students. The learning goal of this course is to be able to understand, design, and implement effective empirical strategies to support empirical claims, particularly causal claims, at the level required for professional researchers of empirical microeconomics. These empirical strategies include randomized experiments with and without compliance, regression discontinuity, the difference-in-difference, and recent techniques such as causal machine learning. In addition, I expect students to understand how to write code in R to perform simulation, estimation, and inference. Finally, I also expect students to learn how to read empirical microeconomics papers critically."

This graduate course provides students in business school with a comprehensive overview of the various topics in behavioral decision theory. These topics include decision-making under risk and uncertainty, decision-making over time, and decision-making in social contexts. This course emphasizes the interplay between theories, experiments, and applications in fields such as finance, labor economics, and development economics. By taking this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of psychological and behavioral factors that influence decision-making, and develop skills on how to model these factors and apply them to real-world scenarios."
