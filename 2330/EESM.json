Even two MOSFETs with the same width and the same length, their properties are not identical due to process variations and various non-ideal effects such as layout dependent effects (LDEs) and parasitic elements in CMOS technology. In this course, students will learn about how the above-mentioned effects affect analog circuit performance, and what kinds of methodologies can be used to minimize their impacts."
