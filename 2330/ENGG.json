Students in this course will be divided into design teams with a common goal: construct their project artifact or virtual 3D model, taken from a wide range of engineering and design contexts. There will be three main aspects: engineering skills, design/creativity, and teamwork. Fundamental engineering skills will be introduced in different engineering fields, such as 3D modelling or hands-on prototyping skills, along with exposure to various kinds of advanced technology available. Some class sessions will focus on design thinking and creativity. They are key to creating practical and interesting products. Students will work together in teams to realize their common idea of their final roadshow project, to have a real-world experience working with a design team."

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F."
