In order to support and grow the structured product business, a variety of functions or roles are developed in the financial industry, including traders, quants, structurers, and sales, etc. at investment banks or relationship managers and product specialists at private banks. As a result, all the financial practitioners are assumed to have basic and practical knowledge about structured products. This course is designed for students who are pursuing front-office careers at investment banks, private banks, or asset management companies. It covers basic concepts of structured products, introduces popular products in the market (e.g., principal protected notes and equity-linked notes), and discusses the landscape of product manufacturing and distribution process. It focuses on applications rather than theory by illustrating real-world examples as well as their practical implementations in the industry."

Topics covered will be (i) Financial Contracting, (ii) Capital Structure and Corporate Strategy , (iii) Agency Problems, Investment Distortions, and Discipline, (iv) Information Asymmetry and Financing,(v) Corporate Governance. The theory will be motivated by and connected to empirical facts, although we will not go into details of empirical papers on the topics. An important goal is to help students learn how to write down a basic model to capture an idea."
