      "description": "This course will help students adapt to university life through advising, sharing and discussion, and applying the science of well‐being to enhance their personal and interpersonal development. It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors.
