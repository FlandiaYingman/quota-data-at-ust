      "description": "Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality."

For the concept of love, love as benevolence in Confucius’ and Mencius’ thoughts and love as universal love in Mohism will be compared and explored. For the concept of death, a naturalistic view of death in contrast to death viewed by Chinese Buddhism and religious Taoism will be introduced. A Confucian view of death will be put forward as a dialectical unity of the previous two seemingly contradictory views of death. As for the concept of human nature, various traditional views of human nature will be discussed and a suggestion is given to explain why Mencius’ idea that human nature is good triumphs over other views and becomes the orthodox view of human nature in the Chinese tradition."

This course is an introduction to those modern histories, presented as a series of case studies. Students will come to understand how science, technology, and medicine are entangled with society and culture. The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others. By the end of the course, students will have a much clearer picture of how science, technology, and medicine are co-produced socially and culturally, and be able to apply those lessons to the world we live in now."

From early photography to virtual reality, it will examine art forms at the turn of the mechanical age (e.g. photography, film) as well as artistic practices in the digital age such as virtual reality, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and NFT (Non-fungible token). Situating art and digital culture within a cross-disciplinary context, the course also considers the following key issues: how do digital technologies change our art, culture, and contemporary life? How does art in the digital age define key issues in the digital world such as privacy, copyright, and identity? How can we create art through interdisciplinary practice? Students will learn to analyze new forms of art and related technologies, and to discuss the key issues of the body, identity, and surveillance in the digital age."

How to identify and interpret place names, objects, peoples and animals depicted in the maps, and how to distinguish the real from the imaginary? Who made these maps, for whom, and for what purposes? How were the images of China produced by Chinese different from those by European cartographers?"

The course also aims to raise awareness of how language is used to create and maintain power through narratives of identity. Case studies will be presented, with a view to deconstructionist analysis on the role of language in producing and reproducing ostensibly stable ‘identities’ along binary lines such as masculine/feminine, Western/Asian and straight/queer. The course also investigates how humans perform other types of social difference and belonging such as ethnicity and social class."

Since we will be working with 'concrete sound', students need not have any prior experience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester."

Through discussions based on a combination of selected readings, films/videos, and music recordings, students will not only get acquainted with popular music well beyond their own or what they normally listen to; they will also gain alternative perspectives on what constitutes \"popular music\" in different East Asian contexts and their significance."

Is it true that each retelling is different? Or do things stay more or less the same despite changes of time? Are there perennial themes that thread through Chinese civilization? Is this a valid question? In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation."
