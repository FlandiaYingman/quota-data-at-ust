Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."

Through a combination of theoretical lectures, hands-on programming assignments, and real-world case studies, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning can be leveraged to enhance decision-making in various domains. Topics covered include data-driven decision-making, integration of prediction and optimization, and reinforcement learning. Students will develop practical skills in implementing and evaluating machine learning models using popular frameworks and tools. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning techniques to make informed decisions, optimize outcomes, and navigate the challenges associated with machine learning-enabled decision-making processes."
