Through lectures, discussions, case-study and presentation, hands-on dis-assembly and re-assembly exercises, students will learn about the basic design principles, design terminology, design skill-sets, design thinking and process, and how a good design relates to the design principles. Students will also learn about what is an integrative system and the importance of using technology to build an integrative system and how it is decomposed into different sub-systems that involve multiple technology components, interacting with each other."

The unmet needs will be identified by observing the daily routine of real services and people. Research on existing solutions and how to conduct the stakeholder and market analyses will be taught for designing the needs screening matrix in needs selection. Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users. This course aims to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, analytical, design and project management skills."

Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design.
