The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This course will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply these concepts in various service industries by conducting a group project."

However, a lot of ML projects in business encounter significant bottlenecks and challenges on their route towards practical deployment at scale. Harnessing AI’s potential for competitive performance requires a new type of professionals, who can automate the deployment of ML models into an integrated system that continuously operate in production. This course is intended to close the gap from machine learning proof-of-concept to production quality system. Through lectures, case discussion and experiments in real-world data sets, students will gain a broad understanding of ML and AI concepts, explore the state-of-art cloud-native system design patterns, and recognize good practice in machine learning system development and deployment."

The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This course will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply these concepts in various service industries by conducting a group project."
