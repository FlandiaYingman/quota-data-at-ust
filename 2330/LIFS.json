In addition, mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been successfully developed, making RNAs more exciting and crucial material to learn. The success of making mRNA vaccines encourages scientists to develop mRNA-based drugs to treat different diseases in the future. This experiential learning course focuses on applying several essential RNA-related technologies in diagnosing and treating human diseases. The course introduces the basic knowledge of RNAs, fundamental principles on RNA-related technologies, and experimental practices for RNA technologies. After learning the basics of RNAs and the principles of six RNA technologies, students will work in teams to develop their projects, and design experiments to make their RNA-related products. By the end of the course, each team will conduct experiments, collect the data, and present and discuss their results at the end of the course. For LIFS/BIBU students in their third or fourth year of study and students with instructor’s consent only."

Registration of pharmaceutical products (drugs, medical devices, food supplements) is a comparatively new biotechnology‐business model, which has evolved from governmental regulations to public health through the assurance of safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. This course emphasizes the essential components of pharmaceutical development; discusses the key stages and decision points in the process; and gives a detailed analysis on the quality control and regulatory requirements. The technological and financial requirements of the development of pharmaceutical products are also covered. Professional training in these disciplines, lacking in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, is crucial for students who plan to pursue further studies or develop their career in the biotechnology sectors."
