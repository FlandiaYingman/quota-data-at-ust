This course aims to help students understand the dynamics of marketing decision-making and the impact these decisions have on society's well-being/\"bad-being\". Students should be able to: (i) appreciate the variety of social, political and economic forces affecting marketing organizations at the global and local level; (ii) identify/analyze current public issues in the interplay between marketing and society, such as advertising to children, junk food, and climate change; (iii) critically evaluate the debates around the ethical responsibilities of marketers; (iv) apply the above learning to real world cases. Students will gain the ability to apply basic theoretical and analytical frameworks to real world marketing problems and cases and reflect on their own behavior and experiences as consumers."
