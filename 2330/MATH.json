      "description": "In this project course, we aim to develop an advance AI framework for air pollution forecasting that takes into consideration environmental factors such as wind and temperature. The project will involve the following tasks: 1. Upgrading the LSTM framework: The student will update our previously developed LSTM framework to incorporate environmental factors that influence air pollutant consideration. They will use Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow to implement the updated framework. 2. Model training and evaluation. The student will train the updated LSTM model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination (R-squared). By completing the project, the student will gain valuable experience in deep learning, data preprocessing, and environmental science. Students should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course."

A well-performing ML model relies on a large volume of training data and high-powered computational resources. There are serious privacy concerns because of possible leakage of highly privacy-sensitive information. Hence, well-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are much needed. PPML is a set of techniques and practices that safeguard sensitive data during the training and deployment of ML models. It allows organizations to harness the power of machine learning while respecting data privacy and ensures that confidential information remains secure and anonymous throughout the AI lifecycle. We will cover other topics such as PPML with large language models and their applications to vertical fields. Students should seek approval from the course instructor to take this reading course."
