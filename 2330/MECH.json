      "description": "This course introduces the applications of modern mechanical engineering technologies to buildings systems and how they relate to our livings. A wise design of building systems offers high convenience to the occupants. Building systems, such as structural design, water supply, safety and air conditioning are of high importance to maintain a satisfying temperature, humidity, lighting and indoor air quality for comfortable living and efficient working. The course introduces the latest trend of building design, such as intelligent, and green buildings, micro sensors, Internet of Things (IoTs), VR/AR and metaverse and AI and how to maintain the sustainability and efficiency of the whole building in terms of building duration, energy and operation. The aim of the course is to provide students fundamental understanding and latest case studies on the current technologies for attaining contemporary living, and the difficulties we are facing that we may be ready for future challenges."

The course's aim is to broaden the professional and engineering interests of students by enhancing their practicum/team-based experience through initiatives different from those of traditional lectures and tutorials. The training is project-based to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project."

All these go to sustainability. The rise of solar power, the surge in popularity of electric cars, and the debates surrounding genetically modified food are all indicative of the complex and interrelated issues we face today. Extreme weather events and the ever-pressing threat of climate change further compound the urgency of our situation.  This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools to address these challenges. We will introduce and elucidate the fundamental design concepts, methods, tools, and technologies associated with lean and green manufacturing systems, supply chains, and green energy. It will also encompass the evaluation, design, and maintenance of environmentally friendly products, processes, services, and policies."
