It introduces the fundamental laws and physics of structural and functional materials including atomic structures and bonding, crystal structures and symmetry, mechanical properties and mechanical tests, microstructure characterization, defects in solids, strengthen mechanisms and diffusion. Specifically, we will highlight the metallic materials and their mechanical properties, deformation mechanisms and enhancement mechanisms. By the end of this course, you should be able to: 1. Understand, recognize and analyze the various types of microstructure of materials such as dislocations, grain boundaries and twins. 2. Understand how the mechanical tests are conducted and be able to process the data to obtain the mechanical properties of materials. 3. Explain the underlying mechanism for the specific physical/mechanical property of the material. 4. Explain the relationship between the processing parameters and the associated mechanical properties and phenomena such as modulus, ductility and strengthening of metallic materials."

      "description": "What business can generate long-term profit? What is the most important topic in this era? What are the most critical challenges to our human society? All these go to sustainability. From the inception of the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s to the ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, the need for sustainable practices has become increasingly apparent. The rise of solar power, the surge in popularity of electric cars, and the debates surrounding genetically modified food are all indicative of the complex and interrelated issues we face today. Extreme weather events and the ever-pressing threat of climate change further compound the urgency of our situation. As an engineer, your role extends beyond acquiring strong technical knowledge and skills. It necessitates an acute awareness of the urgent social, political, and environmental needs that shape our world. This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools to address these challenges. We will introduce and elucidate the fundamental design concepts, methods, tools, and technologies associated with lean and green manufacturing systems, supply chains, and green energy. It will also encompass the evaluation, design, and maintenance of environmentally friendly products, processes, services, and policies. Note that knowledge of Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering is also a requirement outlined by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) accreditation criteria."
