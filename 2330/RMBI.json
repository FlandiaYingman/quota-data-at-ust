      "description": "Business intelligence is a discipline that comprises a set of theories, methodologies and processes to analyze business data with the aim of improving an organization's decision making, business planning and projection. Tomorrow’s employees and executives may not need the advanced skills of a data scientist, but they must be data literate. Therefore, there is a need to bring together data skills and business management by introducing a common core course, specializing at applying data analytics techniques to business scenarios for the implementation of business intelligence. The aim of this course is to introduce the general workflow of business intelligence and various applications of data analytics models in business scenarios. The course also focuses on an analysis of the strengths, limitations, causes and benefits of the use of business intelligence. The course also includes hands-on practical exercises by using data mining and statistics models on real business data sets."
