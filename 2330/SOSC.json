      "description": "This course focuses on practical aspects and implementation of social data analysis by introducing basic techniques for presenting, analysis, and interpreting quantitative data, to Quantitative Social Analysis major students. This course is deliberately designed as complementary to formal and theory-based introductory  statistical courses and substantive and history-based social science courses. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of this course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and  descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn from real-world data. Upon completion of this course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as better understanding of social science research. Enrolment is restricted to students admitted to BSc in Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards."

In less than forty years the region transformed from a backwater to an engine of advanced manufacturing and services. It has lifted millions of people out of poverty, provided homes and communities, and become a node in a global network of megacity regions responsible for much of the world’s economic dynamism. Yet, aspirations are higher. Government, businesses, and others want to harness the region’s synergies to compete with other highly developed bay areas. Becoming an innovative high quality living region is the goal. To understand the region’s successes and challenges, the course examines the GBA’s evolution through the agglomeration processes of external economies, governance and urbanization. These processes led the GBA’s development and will determine its future - in terms of continued economic development and more importantly in terms of the wellbeing of the GBA’s people."

To answer these questions, students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educational experiences, read sociological accounts of education and participate in contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong and across cultures."

Using this perspective puts the logic of statistical inference for both experimental and non-experimental studies within the same framework. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, the course also outlines how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves a set of assumptions or substantive factual information about how the natural world produced the data. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."

It begins with an overview of the Maoist economic system since the communist revolution in 1949. It then examines how the rules governing economic activities have been redefined in major economic sectors since 1978. It also highlights the main features of the new, capitalistic economy and reflects on the issues and challenges that have emerged during the transformation of the economy."

      "description": "This course explores the statistical methods used for causal inference in the social sciences within the potential outcomes framework. Using this perspective puts the logic of statistical inference for both experimental and non-experimental studies within the same framework. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, the course also outlines how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves a set of assumptions or substantive factual information about how the natural world produced the data. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."
